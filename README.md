# MathSim

Eventually I plan to use this code for mathemaical modeling and 
simulations. I'm not sure exactly what I want to build right now,
so the code might appear a bit messy. At the moment I'm playing with
4D projections. Last test is a projection of a single tesseract face,
rotating in the 3 W planes in real time. You need GLFW and Anttweakbar 
to build.
Ideas and constructive criticism are welcome.
